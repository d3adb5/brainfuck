# brainfuck

This repository contains interpreters of the [Brainfuck][bf] esoteric
programming language written by yours truly. It's stuff that I made or at least
started a long time ago for fun.

Don't take any of this very seriously, but hey, if you think there are ways to
improve upon anything here, let me know! I'm always open to learning new things.
