# bfpy

A [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/brainfuck) interpreter written in
Python.

There are options and everything, it's actually quite fancy. Check things with:

	./bf.py -h

# randfile.c

This is a short program that generates random Brainfuck programs/scripts,
written in C for who knows what reason.

# Issues?

There are supposedly none? I think self interpreters don't work very well, but
that's up for testing again.
